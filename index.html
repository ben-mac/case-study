    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>A migration from HTML-based web pages to Drupal 7 threatened to overload California State University, Los Angeles’ Administrative Technology department. With only 7 employees, they alone were tasked with migrating 26 department websites over to the new platform quickly, accurately and with a universal structure that provided distributed control and global governance.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the Information Technology Services web department’s 2 employees were charged with implementing best practices and establishing tools that would allow them to more efficiently support and unify 6 divisions and their approximately 100 websites.</p>
        
    <p>Here’s how we helped Cal State LA migrate their systems and content over to a Drupal CMS, along the way defining standard operating procedures, best practices, and audit procedures that would be used to ensure university web standards were maintained long into the future.</p>
